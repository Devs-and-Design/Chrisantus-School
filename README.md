## CONTRIBUTION GUIDE

1. On your terminal, clone repository using: ```git clone <paste-the-remote-url-of-the-repo>```

2. Switch to dev branch: ```git checkout dev```

3. Create a branch with your name as this is where the testing and this is the branch all work will be taking place and the branch you will be creating a PR from: ```git checkout -b <name of branch>```

4. Get the latest code from the parent repo and merge : ```git pull origin main```

5. You can start working on your task.

6. You can check the branch you are working on using : ```git branch```

7. Once you are done with coding, stage your changes: ```git add .```

8. Then commit your changes your local branch: ```git commit -m "your reason for adding the code"```

9. You can check the files yet to be staged and committed with ```git status```

10. Then check the parent repo if there has been any update since the last time you pull to avoid conflicts and have a work that is in sync by pulling from the parent repo again: ```git pull origin main```

11. Once it is done merging, push your changes to your own repo: ```git push origin dev```

12. Then go to your repo, click on make contributions (if create a pull request doesn't show up) and create a pull request.

13. Compare parent development branch with your own development branch and create a pull request

⚠️ REMEMBER: Always pull before pushing : ```git pull origin main```
